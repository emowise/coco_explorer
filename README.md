1. Packages:
   1.1 State Management: Bloc,Provider 1.2 Api calls: http 1.3 Dependency Injection: get_it 1.4
   Comparing object for bloc pattern :  equatable 1.5 For logs: Logger

2. I used clean Architecture with Bloc and Provider
3. I used some SOLID principles

4. How it works? Type category names by putting coma between each name. The app will search by
   converting string to list

5. I was working this weekend from 10 am to 4 pm (Monday 8 am to 5 pm) for urgent task from Huawei
   which is my current company. That is why I could not spend so much time for the task. End of the
   monday was the last day of this task to finish. Because of reasons I mentioned, I did not have
   time for writing test, and did not any time for refactor project(moving classes, methods).

6. For some images , canvas draws perfectly. But there are some bugs for creating canvas paint. Some
   images scale is not correct. I use same scale for all images by getting real size of the image
   from http. But the points come from http could be incorrect (Its a possibility). The bugs on some
   canvas images could be solved in short time. The solution is to check scale again and to test it.I didnt have time for fixing canvas bugs but it is easy to fix

7. I do not have Mac. I tried to change target iOS 14.0 or greater but it can be wrong.
